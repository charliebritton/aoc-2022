# Advent of Code 2022

## THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR AOC 2022 PROBLEMS

This is my repository for Advent of Code 2022. I have written most of my solutions in Go, after initially trying to setup Haskell with a test spec for when things get a bit harder and then deciding it wasn't worth my time.

Test data for each day to verify code works is in `data/dayNt` and `data/dayNa` is for the actual data.

Code is a bit messy and not as efficient as it could be.

## Writeups
*(I only started to do these a few days in and I've forgotten most of the ways of thinking for the first few)*
- [Day 9](writeups/day9.md)
- [Day 10](writeups/day10.md)
- [Day 11](writeups/day11.md)
- [Day 12](writeups/day12.md)
