# Day 12
After a break for most of the week to do some coursework I'm back on it...

Well that was rather annoying to be honest. I spent loads of time figuring out heuristics and going for DFS from the start, wanted to sanity check myself which obviously showed me that my method was wrong (yippee)!

Glad I figured out it was some search problem and if I wanted to be really inefficient I could probably have done it with DFS or something with good heuristics, although it wouldn't necessarily be optimal. Most of my time was spent checking my legality function for the moves and on the visualisation aspect of things.

There's a lot of code that I don't really need in there and as ever I'm feeling like it's time to start writing tests in for parts of the code. Writing the BFS function was easy enough and with lots of time I feel like it could be improved to show a current search and flash up the trail or something.

I thought the spiral pattern was quite cool and that the second part was quite a natural follow on from the start.

All in all, enjoyed this one but think that maybe I could've been more sensible with the way I programmed.
